# XGBoost

If you want to run the end-to-end.py file then you probably have to install some additional packages.
Also keep in mind that end-to-end.py is targeted towards python 3.6.

1. open python console:

	```
		>>> import nltk
		>>> nltk.download("stopwords")
		>>> nltk.download("punkt")
		>>> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

		or nltk.download("all")
	```	

2. install xgboost:
	``` pip install xgboost // check that your pip version belongs to the python version you are using ```

3. ``` conda install libgcc	```
